#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANS: 
It is the practice of designing and writing code and thereafter testing and fixing bugs. It is important in the technology industry because it enables us to leverage on tools like programming languages , code editors and version control to solve real world problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANS: 
The emergence of the agile software software development methodology which emphasised collaboration with clients in projects, flexibility in project design and rapid development of programmes.

The arrival of cloud computing which enabled software engineers to get more affordable and easily accessible computing power for development.

DevOps which combines software engineering and operations to enhance collaboration for faster delivery of projects.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS:
Planning - This is where the software developer seeks to understand the issue that the client has and work with them to define a scope that will be used to solve the problem. They also define the roadmap that will be followed to come up with the end product.
Requirements - this is where the software engineering team works with the client to analyse and document the different needs of the end product. These needs will act as the reference point for the entire project.
Design - in this stage the software development team builds the framework for the product. This includes coming up with process flows, deciding how the user interfaces will work and how data will be pulled from the database.
Implementation -This is the actual work where the software development team does the coding and development based on the defined scope using the framework that was agreed on in the design phase.
Testing - The software development team checks on product that they have developed in the implementation stage and resolves bugs that they may find.
Deployment - The tested product is rolled out. The client tests it in the real world and starts using it.
Maintenance - The software development team supports the client by making sure the product is always up and running. They also troubleshoot and debug any issues that the client finds and make changes based on their feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS:
In the waterfall methodology there is a step by step approach to the project. One step is completed before moving on the next one and the client is not involved much while the agile methodology uses a flexible approach to a project where there is a lot of client collaboration and their changing needs are taken into account during the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ANS:
A software developer collaborates with fellow software developers to to design products, writes code to build the products and fixes bugs that they find while testing the product.

A quality assurance engineer makes sure the product built by the software engineer meets the requirements that were defined during the planning and requirement phases of the project. They do this by testing the product to identify any bugs and gives feedback on the same so that they are fixed. They also give suggestions on where improvements can be made to make the final product better.

A project manager is in charge of coordinating the entire project. They come up with the project proposal which includes the scope of the project and the budget. They then gather the necessary resources needed for the project and allocate these resources in the best way possible to ensure the success of the project. They also communicate with the client to update on the status of the project and any arising matters.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANS:
IDE's combine the functionality of several coding tools into one application. They allow software developers to write code, run it and debug it in the same place thus making the software development process more efficient. Examples are Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm.

VCS's allow software developers to track changes to their projects by showing different milestones in the project where code was commited. The software developer can also include their own references when committing changes to make it easier for them to track changes. Examples are GitHub and AWS CodeCommit

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ANS:
Evolving client needs and demands - Clients often change their demands during the project and this can throw projects off completely. To overcome this software engineers need to communicate with project managers to ensure that thorough scoping is done. They also need to ensure that the client is involved throughout the project so that any issues are caught early on.

Tight and sometimes unrealistic deadlines - CLients often want the product "now" or even "yesterday". The reality of software development is that projects often get complicated due to customisations that may take time or even lack of resources due to tight budgets. To overcome this challenge it is important that as part of the project proposal, clear and realistic timelines are set taking into account constraints like labour and budget as well as the project requirements.

Software security - In a world where everything is going digital some malicious people often want access to peoples software to steal information, sell it and some just because they want to do it. To mitigate this, software engineers need to equip themselves with knowledge of potential cybersecurity threats and the steps needed to reduce the risk of those things happening to their software. They also need to build in security solutions into their software like Security Socket Layers for web-based projects.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
ANS:
Unit Testing - This is where the functionality of individual modules of a sotware are tested. It is important because it checks how well each module works individually and allows for bugs that may cause issues in the future to be caught early.
Performance Testing -This is where a software is pushed to its limits to see how well it handles stress. It is important because it shows the team how hard the software can be pushed.
Integration Tetsing - This is where the project team tests how well the different modules of a software work together. It is important because it shows how well the software in the real world since the modules will be integrated.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ANS:
This is where we ask AI to do something by engaging it through a set of commands. It is important because if we want to get the desired results from AI we need to know how to talk to it.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANS:
Vague prompt - What are the steps of software development
Improved prompt - List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
